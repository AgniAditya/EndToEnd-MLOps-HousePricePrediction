# 🏠 End-to-End MLOps: House Price Prediction

An open-source, production-grade workflow for building, deploying, and monitoring machine learning models to predict house prices. This project demonstrates best practices in MLOps by covering the entire lifecycle of an ML solution—from data collection to model retraining and maintenance.

---

## 🚀 What does this project do?

- **Automates** the full pipeline: data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, validation, deployment, and monitoring.
- **Implements MLOps** principles, enabling rapid iteration, reproducibility, and robust model management.
- **Predicts house prices** using machine learning on real-world datasets, serving as a reference for similar regression problems.

## 💡 Why is this project useful?

- **Real-World Template**: Jumpstart your own ML projects with a complete, modular MLOps setup.
- **Learning Resource**: Understand and apply industry-standard patterns for continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) in ML.
- **Scalable & Maintainable**: Designed for extensibility, so you can adapt it for your own datasets and workflows.
- **Demonstrates Automation**: Covers retraining, model versioning, and monitoring to keep your predictions up-to-date and reliable.
