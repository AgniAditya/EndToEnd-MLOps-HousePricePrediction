# EndToEnd-MLOps-HousePricePrediction

## What the project does

This project demonstrates an end-to-end MLOps pipeline for house price prediction. It covers the entire lifecycle of a machine learning project, from data ingestion and preprocessing, model training and evaluation, to deployment and monitoring. The solution provides automation around the building, testing, deployment, and retraining of a predictive model using industry-standard MLOps practices.

## Why the project is useful

House price prediction is a classic problem in real estate analytics. This project is useful for:
- Learning how to operationalize ML models using MLOps best practices.
- Automating the workflow for reliable, repeatable, and scalable machine learning deployments.
- Demonstrating how to maintain and monitor ML models in production.
- Serving as a template for similar regression problems in different domains.

## How users can get started with the project

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AgniAditya/EndToEnd-MLOps-HousePricePrediction.git
   cd EndToEnd-MLOps-HousePricePrediction
   ```

2. **Set up your environment:**
   - Ensure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
   - Install required packages using:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Explore the notebooks:**
   - Open the Jupyter notebooks to understand each step: data processing, model building, and deployment.
   - Follow the instructions in the notebooks or scripts to run the pipeline.

4. **Modify or extend:**
   - You can use your own dataset or adjust the pipeline for other regression tasks.
