    Complete ML training pipeline orchestrated by ZenML
    
    This pipeline executes the following steps in sequence:
    1. Data Ingestion: Load data from CSV file
    2. Data Cleaning: Preprocess and prepare data for training
    3. Model Training: Train the Random Forest model
    4. Model Evaluation: Calculate and log performance metrics
    
    Args:
        data (str): Path to the CSV file containing house price data
    
    Returns:
        None: The pipeline saves the trained model and logs metrics to MLflow
